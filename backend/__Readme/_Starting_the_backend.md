## Installing dependencies (Back end)

1) cmd ou open terminal Ã  la racine du Back End
2) delete package-lock.json
3) npm install
4) Install these dependencies locally
    npm i ts-node typescript

5) Refactoring package.json file

Replace "start": "nodemon ./dist/index.js"  by  "start": "nodemon ./src/index.ts",

## Establish the connection with the local postgreSQL database

6) Inside the .env file

PORT=8080
DB_NAME="testdb"
DB_USER="postgres"
DB_PASSWORD="dbiaelflor123"
DB_HOST="localhost:5432"

## Launch the backend

npm start

## If the connection with database is all good

Server is running on port 8080

## Open pgAdmin 4

Super user mot de passe:

lnabiaflorcarladb18

## pgAdmin 4: Use the query tool to search inside the tables previously created

Go to Servers > PostregreSQL 15 > Databases (X) > testdb > Clic-droit > Query Tool

We initialize the creation of the tables inside of the selected database (inside the following file):

    .\nuxt-express-and-typescript-postgres-authentication-main\backend\src\app\models\user.model.ts

    const User = db.define<UserInstance>("user2", {
        fullname: DataTypes.STRING,
        email: DataTypes.STRING,
        password: DataTypes.STRING,
    });
    export default User;

## Some important details from the backend and the postgreSQL connexion and CRUD system

WARNING - IF A TABLE OF THE NAME USER ALREADY EXIST, ALL THE FOLLOWING FIELD WON'T BE CREATED

Will be add a s after the name of table giveb ==> user2

Go to Servers > PostregreSQL 15 > Databases (X) > testdb > Clic-droit > Query Tool

SQL QUERY ==> SELECT * FROM public.user2s

You can see the new user created from the front end (nuxt)

## Assure that the refreshTokens table containsn the right foreign key for the tables user2s

If not delete the table and recreate in relauching the backend server

## If everything is ok

You will see the page ==> You're in home page
